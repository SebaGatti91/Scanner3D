# Scanner3D

## Project Description

This project represents my final work for my electronic engineering degree, where I designed and developed a 3D scanner using Intel's RealSense technology and an SR3000 camera. The main application was built with Qt Creator using C++, while hardware interaction, such as the rotating platform, was implemented using Arduino.

## Key Features

- **Technologies Used:**
  - [Intel RealSense](https://www.intelrealsense.com/)
  - C++ with Qt Creator
  - Arduino

- **Devices:**
  - SR3000 Camera
  - 3D-printed rotating platform and camera support
  - 28BYJ-48 stepper motor with Arduino and ULN2003 driver

## Functionalities

- 3D data capture using RealSense technology.
- Control and communication with the SR3000 camera.
- Implementation of a rotating platform for data capture from different angles.
- Arduino integration for precise control of the stepper motor.
